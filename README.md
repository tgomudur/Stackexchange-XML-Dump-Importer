# Stackexchange-XML-Dump-Importer
This is a python wrapper to import XML dump of all stackexchange sites into MySQL using python. 

> The `root_path`should contain the *extracted* folders of the stackexchange 7z data dumps.

 **TODO:** 

- Automatically extract the 7z data in the script. subprocess is one way of doing it. Still exploring other modules to make it less platform dependant.
- Object-oriented code.
